# Secure Password Manager - Security Improvements - ECE AUTH

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Information Systems Security** course at the **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki**, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Academic Year 2024â€“2025).

The goal of the assignment was to analyze and improve the security of a simplified password manager web application written in PHP with a MySQL database backend. The original application contained several serious security vulnerabilities, which were identified, demonstrated, and mitigated as part of this work.

## Objectives

- Identify existing security vulnerabilities in the provided web application.
- Demonstrate how those vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- Propose and implement appropriate mitigations to improve the security of the application.
